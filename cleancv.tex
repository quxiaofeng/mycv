    \jobtitle{Research Assistant, Part-time}{The Hong Kong Polytechnic University}{Jun 2013 - February 2014}
    \jobdescription{
        I had been developing a virtual and physical interactive human body model system for the Institute of Textiles \& Clothing. A real-time 3D data collecting device was interfaced with python in order to customize virtual 3D human body model, which was rendering by Python and OpenGL.
    }

    \jobtitle{Editor Assistant, Part-time}{International Journal of Image and Graphics (IJIG)\\}{September 2010 - March 2012}
    \jobdescription{
        I work as an editor assistant for the chief editor. I oversaw the manuscript reviewing process including submitting and reviewing; made acceptance decisions based on associate editors' suggestions; and coordinated with the publishing house. I also organized special issues; communicated with AE and reviewers to make the reviewing process efficient and not jammed. In this nineteen months, five issues (from 2011 Jan to 2012 Jan) were published under my supervision, and a simple but efficient local journal management and reporting system was developed using Microsoft Access.
    }

	\jobtitle{Research Assistant}{The Hong Kong Polytechnic University}{April 2008 - March 2010}
    \jobdescription{
        I had made some biometric systems based on 51soc/Cypress USB/ARM/DSP/FPGA. In four systems, I had been working as a core member.
